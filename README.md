# Backlogged
This repo contains all the relevant work for the Backlogged project, part of the "Software Engineering 1" course of the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
## What is Backlogged?
Backlogged is a social media platform designed to provide users the ability to manage their ever-expanding gaming backlog, socialize through their love for gaming, review games and find new ones. Users can follow others to find what they're up to, get recommendations for games based on their taste and stay up-to-date with the latest games releasing. Not only that, they can create personalized playlists and share them with others and collaborate on lists together. This repository consists of the basic design of Backlogged, with no actual code in it. The actual implementation will be available on it's own repository.
